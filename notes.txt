#then clone the github pages to get all the new docs (in the colabDocs folder)
#git clone https://github.com/tbonne/IntroDataScience.git

then move the ipynb files to the docs folder of the peds workspace folder

2. build book (from one dir above peds)

jupyter-book clean peds/
jupyter-book build peds/

3. Git
stage and commit within the peds folder
git add ./*
git commit -m "adding my first book!"
