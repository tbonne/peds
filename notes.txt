This is just to keep notes about the commands for building and publishing this book

0. Start the bookdown conda environment

source ~/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
conda activate bookdown

1. Make changes to notebooks in docs folder

Double check that the notebook as edited in VScode works well in colab (formatting issues sometimes)

2. build book (from one dir above peds)

jupyter-book clean peds/
jupyter-book build peds/

3. Git
stage and commit within the peds folder
git add ./*
git commit -m "adding my first book!"
git push

4. publish the book on github pages (from peds folder)

ghp-import -n -p -f _build/html

5. View final book version

https://tbonne.github.io/peds #/intro.html

Next steps:
-need to add in the data challenges (challenge 2 needs the right data!)
-need to go over content 
-need to start to build the second version of this book (deep leanring in python)
-need to see if i can change the orientation of the figure on page 1 (too low quality)
