# Introduction to PEDS

This book is for learning about data science from practical examples. It presents a series of notebooks that walk you through a typical data science workflow. It will start off with notebooks that are completely filled in and as you progress there will be more and more sections where you'll have to fill in code. Don't worry all the code and concepts you need will be in the eariler notebooks. With this approach you can build you confidence in doing data science in python.
