Now that we can bring data in and work with the data it’s time to learn how to explore the data. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a growing field of research with many approaches. In this part of the book, we will go through the basics of visualizing your data using plots, and how to describe those data using summary statistics. Finally, we’ll introduce unsupervised learning approaches to find clusters in your data. The main idea behind EDA is that by exploring your data you can find unexpected patterns that could lead to further insights into your question. It also is an important step in understanding your data, e.g., are there errors in the data, what is the range of values i’m working with. All very important when working with machine learning models we’ll introduce in the next part of the book.
At the end of this part you’ll have the opportunity to run your own exploratory data analysis!
