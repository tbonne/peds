# <font color='darkorange'>Let's start coding</font>

Starting off in data science can be difficult, especially if you are learning to code and to do data science at the same time. This first chapter introduces you to the basics of Colaboratory, an easy to setup coding environment that let’s us dive right into the course without having to setup your computer to start coding. We’ll then look at some basics of python to start you off! In the next sections, and throughout the book, you’ll see the option to open many of these pages in colaboratory direcelty. If you click on the “open in colab” image at the top left of the page, you’ll be able to edit and run the code as you go along with this text. You can also save a copy to your google drive to look at later. Try it out in the next section - Collaboratory Notebooks
